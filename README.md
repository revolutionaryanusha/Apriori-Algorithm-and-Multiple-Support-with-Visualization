# Apriori-Algorithm-and-Multiple-Support-with-Visualization
Implementing the Apriori algorithm in Python from scratch and extending  it to simultaneously handle multiple minimum support(MIS) thresholds. Applying GSP (Generalized Sequence Pattern) as well. Using data visualization techniques to explore and analyze the frequent itemsets generated by the Apriori implementation.
